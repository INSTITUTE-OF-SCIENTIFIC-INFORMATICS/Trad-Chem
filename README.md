# TradChem

TradChem is an open-source project to create a comprehensive chemical database
for traditional medicinal systems. It gathers data such as product names, benefits,
diseases treated, chemical composition, and SMILES notations. The goal is to
eventually feed this structured data into an LLM for predictive analysis.

## Project Structure

- **tradchem/**: Main package containing the core code.
  - **tradchem.py**: Main class for handling TradChem operations.
  - **version.py**: Version information.
  - **data/**: Contains the default database in JSON format.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for SMILES handling.
  - **medicine_systems/**: Modules for various traditional medicine systems (e.g., Ayurvedic, Traditional Chinese).
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project.
